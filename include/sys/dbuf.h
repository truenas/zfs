 * The simplified state transition diagram for dbufs looks like:
 *
 *
 *		+-> PARTIAL_FILL <---> PARTIAL-+
 *		|		 	  |    |
 *		+---------->READ_FILL<----[----+
 *		|		^	  |
 *		|		|	  |
 *		|		V	  |
 *		+-----------> READ ------+[-------+
 *		|			 ||	  |
 *		|			 VV	  V
 *  (alloc)-->UNCACHED----------------->FILL--->CACHED----> EVICTING-->(free)
 *		|						^
 *		|						|
 *		+--------------------> NOFILL ------------------+
 *
 *
 * Reader State Transitions:
 * UNCACHED ->	READ:		Access to a block that does not have an
 *				active dbuf.  A read is issued to media
 *				upon an ARC or L2ARC miss.
 *
 * READ -> CACHED:		Data satisfied from the ARC, L2ARC, or
 *				a read of the media.  No writes occurred.
 *
 * PARTIAL -> READ:		Access to a block that has been partially
 *				written but has yet to have the read
 *				needed to resolve the COW fault issued.
 *				The read is issued to media.  The ARC and
 *				L2ARC are not involved since they were
 *				checked for a hit at the time of the first
 *				write to this buffer.
 *
 * Writer State Transitions:
 * UNCACHED ->	FILL:		Access to a block that does not have an
 *				active dbuf.  Writer is filling the entire
 *				block.
 *
 * UNCACHED -> PARTIAL_FILL:	Access to a block that does not have an
 *				active dbuf.  Writer is filling a portion
 *				of the block starting at the beginning or
 *				end.  The read needed to resolve the COW
 *				fault is deferred until we see that the
 *				writer will not fill this whole buffer.
 *
 * UNCACHED -> READ_FILL:	Access to a block that does not have an
 *				active dbuf.  Writer is filling a portion
 *				of the block and we have enough information
 *				to expect that the buffer will not be fully
 *				written.  The read needed to resolve the COW
 *				fault is issued asynchronously.
 *
 * READ -> READ_FILL:		Access to a block that has an active dbuf
 *				and a read has already been issued for the
 *				original buffer contents.  A COW fault may
 *				not have occurred, if the buffer was not
 *				already dirty.	Writer is filling a portion
 *				of the buffer.
 *
 * PARTIAL -> PARTIAL_FILL:	Access to a block that has an active dbuf
 *				with an outstanding COW fault.	Writer is
 *				filling a portion of the block and we have
 *				enough information to expect that the buffer
 *				will eventually be fully written.
 *
 * PARTIAL -> READ_FILL:	Access to a block that has an active dbuf
 *				with an outstanding COW fault.	Writer is
 *				filling a portion of the block and we have
 *				enough information to expect that the buffer
 *				will not be fully written, causing a read
 *				to be issued.
 *
 * PARTIAL -> FILL:		Access to a block that has an active dbuf
 *				with an outstanding COW fault.	Writer is
 *				filling enough of the buffer to avoid the
 *				read for this fault entirely.
 *
 * READ -> FILL:		Access to a block that has an active dbuf
 *				with an outstanding COW fault, and a read
 *				has been issued.  Write is filling enough of
 *				the buffer to obsolete the read.
 *
 * I/O Complete Transitions:
 * FILL -> CACHED:		The thread modifying the buffer has completed
 *				its work. The buffer can now be accessed by
 *				other threads.
 *
 * PARTIAL_FILL -> PARTIAL:	The write thread modifying the buffer has
 *				completed its work. The buffer can now be
 *				accessed by other threads.  No read has been
 *				issued to resolve the COW fault.
 * 
 * READ_FILL -> READ:		The write thread modifying the buffer has
 *				completed its work. The buffer can now be
 *				accessed by other threads. A read is
 *				outstanding to resolve the COW fault.
 *
 * The READ, PARITIAL_FILL, and READ_FILL states indicate the data associated
 * with a dbuf is volatile and a new client must wait for the current consumer
 * to exit the dbuf from that state prior to accessing the data.
 * 
 * The PARITIAL_FILL, PARTIAL, READ_FILL, and READ states are used for
 * deferring any reads required for resolution of Copy-On-Write faults.
 * A PARTIAL dbuf has accumulated write data in its dirty records
 * that must be merged into the existing data for the record once the
 * record is read.	A READ dbuf is a dbuf for which a synchronous or
 * async read has been issued.	If the dbuf has dirty records, this read
 * is required to resolve the COW fault before those dirty records can be
 * committed to disk.  The FILL variants of these two states indicate that
 * either new write data is being added to the dirty records for this dbuf,
 * or the read has completed and the write and read data are being merged.
 *
 * Writers must block on dbufs in any of the FILL states.
 *
 * Synchronous readers must block on dbufs in the READ,	 and any
 * of the FILL states.	Further, a reader must transition a dbuf from the
 * UNCACHED or PARTIAL state to the READ state by issuing a read, before
 * blocking.
 *
 * The transition from PARTIAL to READ is also triggered by writers that
 * perform a discontiguous write to the buffer, meaning that there is
 * little chance for a latter writer to completely fill the buffer.
 * Since the read cannot be avoided, it is issued immediately.
